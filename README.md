An investment calculator in which you can enter some data about your planned investments.<br>
For example, your current savings, the amount you are going to add each year, the expected return on investment, your time horizon, i.e. the timing of these investments.<br>
Once you enter the data, you will get a table with the results of the calculations, where you can see by year how much interest you will get, etc.
